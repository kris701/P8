# Data Converters
This folder is to convert TS data over to the format that the protonet uses.
One or more transformations may be used in the process.
There is a bunch of different setting options in `DataConverterOptions.py`, that can be used to configure the converters.

You can get specific converters by using `DataConverterBuilder.py`.
