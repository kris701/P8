# Data folder
You can place any folder with data here.
E.g. with the dataset `SwedishLeaf` the strucure should look like:
```
-> Data
 | -> SwedishLeaf
    | -> README.md
      -> SwedishLeaf_TEST.tsv
      -> SwedishLeaf_TRAIN.tsv
```
All folders added in here ignored by git, so dont worry about anything you put in here.
If you are taking data from the UCR archive, you can just paste the entire archive in here (unzipped of course)
