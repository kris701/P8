# Data folder
You can place any folder with data here.
E.g. with the dataset `SwedishLeaf` the strucure should look like:
```
-> Data
 | -> SwedishLeaf
    | -> README.md
      -> SwedishLeaf_TEST.tsv
      -> SwedishLeaf_TRAIN.tsv
```
All folders added in here ignored by git, so dont worry about anything you put in here.
