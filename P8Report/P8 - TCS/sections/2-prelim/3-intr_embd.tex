\subsection{Interpretability}
The following segment will provide an overview of interpretability and elucidate why it is a topic that has seen interest in the context of machine learning.

%Short overview
The concepts of \textit{artificial intelligence (ai)} and \textit{machine learning (ML)} are often seen as intimidating black box models that cannot be understood by the general public. Through various techniques, interoperability tries to explain the black-box models into a domain that the general public can understand.
