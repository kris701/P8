%\section{Motivation}
%With this semester's focus being on machine intelligence, the group was presented with ten fields of interest in which machine intelligence may be applied. One in particular stood out to the members of this group: music generation. Of the group's six members, five play an instrument, and, though proficiency among group members varies, each member takes interest in musical theory. Perhaps even more pertinent for this project is simply that every member takes pleasure in music, and finds it stimulating. 

%It has long been known that students perform better while listening to Mozart's compositions\cite{bbcmozart}, and recent years have seen a boom in "lo-fi"/"study music", which students will purportedly listen to while studying. This poses an interesting question: can a machine intelligence be designed to compose a perpetual tune in the style of the aforementioned study music? This question was the impetus behind the group's motivation to pursue the design and implementation of a machine intelligence able to generate music in perpetuity.
%We should perhaps mention the things we discussed with the problem definition, such as wanting to create royalty free music and such here before it can be mentioned in the problem definition
