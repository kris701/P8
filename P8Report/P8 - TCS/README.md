# aauLatexTemplates
On this page, I have collected various Latex-related templates which may be useful to you. The site contains three beamer templates, a report template, a Ph.D.-thesis template, and a poster template which are all described in more detail below. These are primarily intended for use by other people studying or working at Aalborg University (AAU), but everyone is encouraged to use the templates.

## Beamer Themes
A lot of the people at AAU use the beamer class to make their presentations which they give at exams, lectures, conferences, and workshops. These people often use one of the many standard beamer themes for their presentations. There is nothing wrong with these themes, and they serve their purpose. However, they are not very unique and do not promote Aalborg University very well. In order to avoid this, I have created three Beamer themes:

- The AAU Simple Beamer Theme<br />

See [an example/the documentation](aauBeamer/aausimple/AAUsimpletheme.pdf).
- The AAU Sidebar Beamer Theme<br />

See [an example/the documentation](aauBeamer/aausidebar/AAUsidebartheme.pdf).
- The Aalborg Beamer Theme<br />

See [an example/the documentation](aauBeamer/aalborg/aalborgtheme.pdf).

If you like these, but are not affiliated with Aalborg University, you are very welcome to modify them. The easiest theme to modify is the Aalborg theme.

## The AAU Report Template
 Many students use LaTeX for typesetting their reports. Although LaTeX is very powerful and able to create beautiful documents, the learning curve for LaTeX novices may be quite steep. Especially the management of the layout may be hard.

This report template is an attempt to give these LaTeX novices a gentle start. The template takes care of loading the most common packages in the preamble, creating a front page, an English and a Danish AAU title page, a preface with signatures, and a simple folder structure for organising the tex-files.

See [an example/the documentation](aauReportTemplate/master.pdf).

## The AAU Ph.D. Thesis Template
 Most Ph.D.-students at Aalborg University write their thesis as a collection of papers. That is, the thesis consists of two parts. The first part contains an introduction to the problem, the state-of-the-art and the contributions made by the Ph.D.-student and his/her co-authors. The second part contains the relevant paper published during the Ph.D.

This template can be used for writing such a thesis. The template takes care of loading the most common packages in the preamble, creating a front page, an English and a Danish abstract, a preface, the two parts, and a simple folder structure for organising the tex-files. 

See [an example/the documentation](aauPhdCollectionThesis/master.pdf).

## The AAU Poster Theme

 When researchers and students from Aalborg University (AAU) attend conferences around the world, they often use a poster for presenting their newest research results. To the best of my knowledge no AAU-branded poster theme is available to these researchers and students so they have to create their own or modify an existing theme.

In order to avoid this, I have therefore created an AAU poster theme. The theme, which I have named aauposter, is simple, clean and unique. It is a particular configuration of the baposter class, and you have to download the baposter.cls file to use the AAU poster theme.

See [an example/the documentation](aauPoster/aauposter.pdf).
